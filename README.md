Liu Q, Zhang Y, Cai Z. Classification and enumeration of lattice polygons in a disc[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.14899, 2023.

The files "list_of_polygons_radius_2.mat", "list_of_polygons_radius_3.mat" and "list_of_polygons_radius_4.mat" are the lists of convex lattice polygons in the disc of radius 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Each of these three files contains two columns of cells, the i-th cell in the first column contains the lattice polygons with i+2 lattice points, and the i-th cell in the second column contains only a number, i+2.

Every lattice polygon is represented by a matrix in this dataset, of which each row is the coordinates of a vertex of the lattice polygon.
